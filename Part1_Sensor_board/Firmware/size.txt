The â€˜bssâ€™ contains all the uninitalized data.
ðŸ’¡ bss (or .bss, or BSS) is the abbreviation for â€˜Block Started by Symbolâ€™ by an old assembler (see this link).

The â€˜decâ€™ (as a decimal number) is the sum of text, data and bss:

â€˜dataâ€™ is used for initialized data. This is best explained with the following (global/extern) variable:


â€˜textâ€™ is what ends up in FLASH memory. I can show this with adding
